GenomeAssembler
Overview
GenomeAssembler is a Java application designed to assemble a genome from a set of reads. It aligns these reads to a reference genome using a suffix array for efficient alignment and assembles them into a contiguous sequence (contig). This tool is particularly useful for bioinformatics applications where large genomic datasets need to be processed.

Features
Reads and Reference Genome Input: Takes a file of reads and a reference genome file as input.
Suffix Array Creation: Constructs a suffix array from the reference genome for efficient searching and alignment.
Read Alignment: Aligns reads to the reference genome based on the suffix array.
Contig Assembly: Assembles the aligned reads into a single contiguous sequence.
Progress Tracking: Provides progress updates during the read alignment and contig assembly processes.
Output: Writes the assembled genome to a file.
Usage
Prerequisites
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) / Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
Input files:
Reads file: A text file containing genome reads.
Reference genome file: A text file containing the reference genome sequence.
Running the Application
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Place your reads file and reference genome file in a known directory.
Compile the GenomeAssembler.java file.
Run the application, passing the paths to your reads file and reference genome file as arguments.
php
Copy code
java GenomeAssembler <path_to_reads_file> <path_to_reference_genome_file>
Implementation Details
Suffix Array: The application creates a suffix array from the reference genome to facilitate efficient alignment of reads.
Alignment Algorithm: The program aligns reads to the reference genome using a simple alignment strategy based on the suffix array. The alignment marks matches, mismatches, and gaps.
Contig Assembly: Once the reads are aligned, the application assembles them into a single contiguous sequence, handling overlaps and mismatches appropriately.
Output: The assembled genome sequence is written to an output file named assembled_reads.txt.
Limitations
It uses a simple alignment approach, which may not be suitable for all types of genomic analysis.
